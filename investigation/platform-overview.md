# Player2 Platform Overview

**Player2** is a platform created by **Elefant AI**, providing AI-driven tools and bots for **Minecraft**, supporting singleplayer, server, and SMP (Survival Multiplayer) experiences. The platform has evolved rapidly since its launch, offering innovative ways to integrate AI into gameplay. Players could interact with AI bots that performed tasks ranging from simple automation to more complex actions like managing resources or assisting in combat.

Originally, Player2 was highly community-focused. The SMP server allowed multiple players to play together alongside AI bots, fostering collaboration, competition, and chaotic gameplay. Many members praised the "anarchy-mode" server for its unpredictability and freedom, which encouraged experimentation and community-driven content.

Over time, significant changes have been implemented:
- Removal of SMP servers, reducing Player2â€™s multiplayer functionality.
- Implementation of a paywall for AI bot access, restricting certain features to **Patreon subscribers**.
- Transition toward AI-centric tools in singleplayer environments, with less emphasis on community collaboration.

Community feedback suggests that while the platform remains functional for individual use, the removal of multiplayer features has fundamentally changed the Player2 experience. Many long-term users have expressed nostalgia for the SMP days, describing them as the most engaging and unique aspect of the platform.
