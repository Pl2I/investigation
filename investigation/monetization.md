# Monetization and Funding

Player2â€™s shift toward monetization has affected both moderators and developers:

- Access to AI bots and advanced features now requires **Patreon subscription**.
- Users must purchase additional in-game currency ("Battery") to maintain AI bot activity.
- Free-tier users face significant limitations, including restricted mod testing and shorter AI session times.

Official statements from the team cite **AI computation costs and budget management** as reasons for monetization. However, a release dated **August 28, 2025**, indicated that **Elefant AI Ltd** had over **$45,000 USD in funds**, prompting questions regarding resource allocation and prioritization.

This monetization strategy has been controversial within the community. Critics argue that Player2 has transitioned from a **community-first project** to a **profit-driven model**, which conflicts with its original values and expectations.
