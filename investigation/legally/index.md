### 1.3 Interpretation

| Aspect | UK Ltd | US Inc (Trademark) |
|---------|--------|--------------------|
| Legal existence | ✅ Registered company | ❌ No corporate record |
| Jurisdiction | United Kingdom | United States (trademark only) |
| Purpose | Operational business entity | IP / branding registration |
| Transparency risk | Moderate | High – can imply false U.S. presence |

**Conclusion:**  
The “Elefant AI Inc.” name appears **only in trademark filings**, not in corporate records.  
It is therefore **a branding or trademark alias**, not a registered U.S. entity.  
Publicly presenting it as “Inc.” without clarification could **mislead moderators, developers, investors, and users** about jurisdiction and accountability.

## 2. Legal & ethical framework for investigators

These principles ensure this repository remains lawful, verifiable, and safe for contributors.

### 2.1 Evidence handling
- Keep **copies of public pages** (via Wayback or archive.today) rather than raw scraped data.
- Store **original files privately** (`data/raw/`); publish only redacted, sourced data (`data/processed/`).
- Record **source metadata**: URL, date, collector, checksum.

### 2.2 Privacy & consent
- Do **not** publish private DMs, emails, or identifiable user data without **explicit written consent**.
- Use the `templates/interview_consent.md` form before citing personal statements.
- When redacting, remove names, usernames, and location details unless they are public officials or executives acting in official capacity.

### 2.3 Defamation & accuracy
- Publish **only verifiable facts** supported by primary sources.
- Attribute every factual claim to its original source.
- Use neutral language (avoid “scam,” “fraud,” etc. unless legally proven).
- Flag any unverified claims as *“unconfirmed / pending verification.”*

### 2.4 Copyright & fair use
- Screenshots of websites, TOS, or app stores generally fall under **fair use for journalistic or research purposes**.
- Cite the original source and timestamp for every image or snippet.
- Avoid redistributing entire proprietary datasets or assets.

### 2.5 Jurisdictional considerations
- Primary legal entity: **Elefant AI Ltd (UK)** → governed by UK law.  
- Trademark filings: **Elefant AI Inc. (US)** → under USPTO jurisdiction.  
- Any complaints or consumer protections should therefore be directed to **UK authorities** (Companies House, ICO, ASA, CMA).

### 2.6 Responsible publication
- Always perform **a final factual review** before committing to `main`.  
- Keep internal discussion and notes out of the public repo unless verified.  
- Include **disclaimers** in published reports:  
  > “All information contained herein is derived from public records or contributor testimony verified where possible. No defamatory intent is implied.”
