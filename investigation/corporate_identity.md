# Corporate Identity and Jurisdiction

Player2 is operated by **Elefant AI**, which presents an inconsistent corporate identity:

- **Elefant AI Ltd**: Registered as a UK private limited company (Company No. 15590241). This is the officially recognized entity responsible for Player2 operations.
- **Elefant AI Inc**: Appears in U.S. **trademark filings**, but no U.S. corporate registration exists. It is likely used solely for intellectual property purposes and branding.

Implications of this discrepancy:
- Users, moderators, and developers may assume a U.S.-based entity with potential jurisdiction benefits, which is inaccurate.
- Public references to “Inc.” without clarification may mislead investors and community members regarding accountability and legal standing.

This inconsistency is relevant for anyone engaging with Player2 commercially, legally, or as part of the moderation and development community.
