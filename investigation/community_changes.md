# Community Changes and SMP Removal

The **Player2 community** has experienced a significant shift due to recent platform changes. The removal of the SMP server has been the most impactful... Previously, the SMP allowed multiple players to interact with AI bots in a shared world...

After the SMP was removed:
- Multiplayer engagement has dropped sharply; most users now play singleplayer.
- Players reported that AI bots became more restricted: full functionality requires both **Patreon subscription** and additional in-game currency ("Battery").
- The new mod introduced to replace SMP functionality has been criticized as lacking interactivity and responsiveness compared to previous AI behavior.

Overall, the Player2 community now appears more fragmented, with a focus on individual play rather than shared multiplayer experiences. Many former SMP users feel disconnected from the platformâ€™s direction.
