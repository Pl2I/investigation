## Moderation & Content Safety (Expanded)

Community members have raised concerns regarding moderation on Player2, citing repeated issues with enforcement, communication, and developer responsiveness.

### Reported Issues

- **AI-generated content:** Bots were able to produce offensive, inappropriate, or harmful language without adequate filtering.  
- **Delayed response:** Reports of bot misbehavior often took extended periods to be acknowledged or resolved.  
- **Community moderation gaps:** The Discord community faced recurring scams, spam, and misleading links. These issues persisted despite the availability of widely used moderation systems such as **Claude** and **Dyno**, which were never properly implemented or maintained.

The moderation system lacked proactive measures for handling AI-generated content. Several users documented instances where bots repeatedly produced harmful messages across multiple sessions. While specific content has been redacted for safety, the key concern remains the **inconsistent and delayed response from the development team**.

Moderation policies also appeared inconsistent. Community contributors noted that attempts to discuss or publicly question Player2’s internal problems were sometimes discouraged by staff or categorized as “complaining.” This led to frustration among moderators and volunteers who sought transparency.

### Part 2: Restrictions for Moderators

Community moderators have reported **strict communication restrictions** on what they are allowed to discuss publicly. According to sources within the Player2 moderation team, staff were instructed to avoid publicly acknowledging or criticizing platform issues.

Below is a screenshot reportedly shared by a verified moderator on the Player2 team, illustrating internal communication guidelines and tone enforcement:
